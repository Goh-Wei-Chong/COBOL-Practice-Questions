Amending IterCalc
Amend the program so that instead of doing a fixed number of calculations (three in IterCalc.Cbl) it asks the user to enter the number of calculations required and then executes the loop that many times.
The version of the PERFORM used in this program has the syntax PERFORM Identifer/Literal TIMES. That is, either an identifer or a literal can be used to indicate how many times the loop is to be executed. The current version of IterCalc.Cbl uses a literal. You must change it so that it uses an identifier.

When run with the same data your amended program should the produce the results shown below.  For purposes of illustration, user input is shown enlarged and in bold.

Example run
Enter the number of calcs required :- 2
Enter First Number : 3
Enter Second Number : 3
Enter operator (+ or *) : *
Result is = 9
Enter First Number : 3
Enter Second Number : 3
Enter operator (+ or *) : +
Result is = 6
